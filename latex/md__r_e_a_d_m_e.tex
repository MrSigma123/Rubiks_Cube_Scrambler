This program is designed to generate 3\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}3\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}3 standard Rubiks Cube scrambles, which are in accordance with official WCA scrambling rules. It\textquotesingle{}s just the console app, but clearly it will be able to do it\textquotesingle{}s work perfectly by using coloring the output in the terminal window.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Quick start}{Quick start}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
